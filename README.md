# MSIA-490: LinkedIn Network Analytics

In this project, we analyzed how our LinkedIn network has changed in the post-COVID era as compared to the pre-COVID era. 

## Project Highlights 

* **Visualization:** We visualize our pre and post COVID networks in the form of graphs, color code key players and analyze the giant-component graph. 
* **Network Statistics:** We analyzed the changes in the network trends and identify the traits of key users using different network statistics like degree, eigenvector and closeness centrality. 
* **Community Analysis:** We analyzed the emergence and changes in communities within the network using k-core decomposition and cluster decomposition algorithms (eg- Newman Girvan algorithm)
* **Small-world characteristics:** We analyzed if the LinkedIn network follows small-world characteristics and if post-COVID era has had any significant impact on it. 
* **Sentiment Analysis:** We use NLP to analyze how the sentiment of users in the network has changed between the pre and post COVID era. 
* **Network Modeling:**  We use STERGM and SIENA models to build a network model and validate hypothesis like -> Whether people are more likely to connect to other people of same profession over time (from pre->post COVID era), whether people are more likely to connect to other people of specific professions (Managers, Directors) etc.
